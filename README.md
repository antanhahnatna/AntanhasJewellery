### Antanha's jewellery

Makes anything from silver, gold and platinum bars at a furnace. The needed items other than the bars come from your bank, and they're withdrawn via load last preset.

### Instructions

This script assumes all your bars are in the metal bank.

Set your last bank preset according to what you want to craft (e.g. 28 rubies), then start the script in Fort Forinthry or Artisan's Workshop.
